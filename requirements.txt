# Download English model for spaCy (run manually after install)

### ✅ Post-install command (manual)

After installing the packages, you should also run the following to get the English model for spaCy:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Let me know if you’d like me to add a `setup.sh` file to automate the virtual environment setup and installation as well.
