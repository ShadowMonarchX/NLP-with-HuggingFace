# 🤖 NLP with Hugging Face Transformers

A hands-on repository to learn and apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) using [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/). This project includes practical notebooks and scripts to help you fine-tune pre-trained language models for various NLP tasks.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository is intended for:

* Beginners and intermediate ML/NLP enthusiasts.
* Developers looking to fine-tune transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, GPT-2, etc.
* Anyone interested in using Hugging Face’s `transformers` and `datasets` libraries effectively.

## 📘 Tutorials Covered

| Topic                              | Description                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text Classification**            | Fine-tune models like BERT to classify text (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis). |
| **Question Answering**             | Build models that answer questions from context using datasets like SQuAD.              |
| **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** | Extract entities (names, dates, places) from unstructured text.                         |
| **Summarization**                  | Use models like BART or T5 to summarize long documents.                                 |
| **Text Generation**                | Generate text using GPT-2 and other decoder models.                                     |

## 🧪 How to Run

### 🔍 1. Using Jupyter Notebooks

Make sure Jupyter is installed:

```bash
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
```

Then open and run any `.ipynb` file from the `notebooks/` directory.

### 🖥️ 2. Using Python Scripts

Example to train a model:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --model_name bert-base-uncased --task text-classification
```

Example to run inference:

```bash
python scripts/infer.py --text "I love machine learning!" --model_path ./models/my_model
```

Modify CLI args or script parameters as needed.
