# ü§ó NLP with HuggingFace Transformers

This repository contains hands-on tutorials and example notebooks for performing various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using Hugging Face's `transformers` library.

---

## üìö Tutorials Included

| Notebook | Task |
|---------|------|
| `1 Emotion Prediction.ipynb` | Predict emotions from text |
| `2 NER Training.ipynb` | Fine-tune a model for Named Entity Recognition |
| `3 Text Generation.ipynb` | Generate text using pretrained language models |
| `4 Summarization.ipynb` | Summarize long text documents |
| `5 Fine Tuning DistilBERT for Multi-Label Classification.ipynb` | Custom fine-tuning for multi-label tasks |
| `6 Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT.ipynb` | Classify sentiment using pretrained models |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
- Datasets: HuggingFace `datasets` library / Custom (where applicable)
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (backend for models)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShadowMonarchX/NLP-with-HuggingFace.git
cd NLP-with-HuggingFace
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> You can also use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run the notebooks without any local setup.
