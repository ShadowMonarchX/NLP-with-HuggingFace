# ü§ó NLP with HuggingFace Tutorials

This repository contains hands-on tutorials and notebooks for learning and applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Each notebook demonstrates a specific task like emotion detection, NER, text generation, summarization, sentiment analysis, and fine-tuning models like DistilBERT for classification.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

| Notebook | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `1 Emotion Prediction.ipynb` | Predict emotions from text using transformer-based models. |
| `2 NER Training.ipynb` | Fine-tune a model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on custom data. |
| `3 Text Generation.ipynb` | Generate coherent text using pretrained generative models. |
| `4 Summarization.ipynb` | Summarize long documents using transformer summarization models. |
| `5 Fine Tuning DistilBERT for Multi-Label Classification.ipynb` | Perform multi-label classification by fine-tuning DistilBERT. |
| `6 Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT.ipynb` | Analyze text sentiment using pretrained DistilBERT models. |
